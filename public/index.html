    <p>the article on the internet was amply descriptive in regards to the evolution of web development. It emereged as a dark and primitve ability with extemely limited desing possibility.At first tables were used as the design for the layout then javascript came along and proved itself a steroid to web design, allowing for pop upwindows, and dyanamic modifcations of orders. then came a tool called flash which allowed the designer to create the architecture , place it one file, and send it to the browser.
